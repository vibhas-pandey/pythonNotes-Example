'''how variable works'''
# x = 10    #10 is assign to x
# y = "vibhas"  #vibhas is assing to y
# z = 20  #20 is assign to z
# w = z   #value of z is assign in w.
# # w = 30  #30 is assign with w
# print(x,y,z,w,w)


# is_valid = True
# marks = 90
# pi = 3.14
# city_name = "noida"
# print(is_valid)
# print(marks)
# print(pi)
# print(city_name)

'''Using variable without assinging its value causing error'''
# print(n)  #n is not defined.
